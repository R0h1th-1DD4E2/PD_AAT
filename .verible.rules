# Verible lint rules configuration (textproto)
# This is a minimal, non-strict ruleset that enables a few common checks
# while otherwise deferring to Verible's defaults. Adjust values as needed.
#
# Note: Verible accepts a textproto-style rules config. The exact schema is
# defined by Verible. This file provides a small, commonly-used subset of
# checks (line length, no tabs, and simple naming hints). If Verible reports
# any parsing errors, we can iterate quickly to adapt this file to the
# installed Verible version.

# Maximum line length (soft limit). Set to 120 to avoid noisy CI failures.
rule {
  name: "LineLength"
  parameters {
    name: "max_length"
    int_value: 120
  }
}

# Disallow tabs — prefer spaces for indentation.
rule {
  name: "NoTabs"
}

# Encourage module and file naming in lower_snake_case (non-strict hint).
rule {
  name: "IdentifierStyle"
  parameters {
    name: "style"
    string_value: "lower_snake_case"
  }
}

# Do not enable very strict checks by default. Add more `rule { ... }`
# blocks above to harden style enforcement when you're ready.
